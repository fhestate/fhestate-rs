## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-29

**Initial public release of fhestate-rs** — Privacy-preserving computation on Solana using Fully Homomorphic Encryption.

### Development Timeline
This release represents **3 months of intensive research, development, and testing** (November 2025 - January 2026).

---

## 🏗️ Development History

### Milestone 1: Research & Evaluation (November 2025)
**Focus:** Evaluating FHE libraries and designing architecture.

#### 📅 November 10-15, 2025
* Researched multiple FHE libraries (SEAL, HElib, TFHE-rs, Concrete).
* Analyzed performance characteristics and Rust compatibility.
* Selected TFHE-rs v0.7.3 for production implementation.
* Initial benchmarking: encryption/decryption performance testing.

#### 📅 November 16-25, 2025
* Designed hybrid FHE-blockchain architecture.
* Evaluated Solana integration approaches (custom program vs SPL).
* Prototyped key generation and encryption flows.
* Documented cryptographic security requirements.

#### 📅 November 26-30, 2025
* Created initial project structure.
* Set up development environment and tooling.
* Defined API surface for SDK.
* Established testing strategy.

**Key Decisions:**
* ✅ **TFHE-rs** for FHE operations (best Rust support).
* ✅ **Hybrid model**: off-chain FHE computation + on-chain proofs.
* ✅ **SHA256** for cryptographic proof generation.
* ✅ **Solana Devnet** for initial deployment.

---

### Milestone 2: Architecture & Core Implementation (December 2025)
**Focus:** Building core infrastructure and FHE operations.

#### 📅 December 1-10, 2025
* Implemented core encryption/decryption module (`src/keys.rs`, `src/math.rs`).
* Built key management system with file-based storage.
* Created FHE operation wrappers (FheUint8 support).
* Initial integration tests for TFHE operations.

#### 📅 December 11-20, 2025
* Developed Solana integration layer.
* Implemented transaction signing and submission.
* Built proof generation system (SHA256 hashing).
* Created wallet management utilities.

#### 📅 December 21-31, 2025
* Designed coordinator program architecture (Anchor-based).
* Implemented task registry and state management.
* Built instruction handlers for task submission/completion.
* Created serialization/deserialization logic.

**Key Deliverables:**
* ✅ FHE encryption/decryption working.
* ✅ Homomorphic operations (add, sub, mul).
* ✅ Solana transaction submission.
* ✅ Cryptographic proof generation.

---

### Milestone 3: Integration & Tooling (January 2026)
**Focus:** Building CLI tools, executor node, and integration testing.

#### 📅 January 1-10, 2026
* Built `fhe-cli` command-line interface.
* Implemented task submission workflow.
* Created wallet creation and management commands.
* Integrated with Solana RPC client.

#### 📅 January 11-20, 2026
* Developed `fhe-node` background executor.
* Implemented blockchain listener for task detection.
* Built task queue and processing system.
* Created result submission logic.

#### 📅 January 21-25, 2026
* Comprehensive integration testing on Solana Devnet.
* Performance optimization and profiling.
* Bug fixes and error handling improvements.
* Security hardening (input validation, error messages).

**Key Features Added:**
* ✅ Complete CLI for task submission.
* ✅ Background node for task execution.
* ✅ Real Solana Devnet integration.
* ✅ Verified on-chain transactions.

---

### Milestone 4: Documentation & Polish (Late January 2026)
**Focus:** Production-ready release with comprehensive documentation.

#### 📅 January 26-27, 2026
* **Documentation Suite:**
  * Created comprehensive README.md.
  * Wrote QUICKSTART.md guide (5-minute setup).
  * Developed ARCHITECTURE.md (technical deep-dive).
  * Built API.md reference documentation.
  * Authored EXAMPLES.md with 12 code examples.
  * Wrote CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines.
  * Created FAQ.md for common questions.

#### 📅 January 28, 2026
* **Production Preparation:**
  * Removed all test/debug artifacts.
  * Added .gitignore for security (keys, wallets, logs).
  * Created MIT LICENSE.
  * Set up examples directory.
  * Final code cleanup and formatting.
  * Version 0.1.0 release preparation.
